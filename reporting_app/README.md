# Reporting App queries
Queries for the FOLIO reporting app belong in this folder. 

Note: queries need both the .sql and .json files:
* the SQL file contains the query itself, and
* the JSON file defines the Web form and the parameter names used in the SQL query.

An optional Markdown (.md) file can provide documentation for the query.
